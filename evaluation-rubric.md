# Project Evaluation

Your instructors will evaluate your project and determine if it is complete or
incomplete. We use the following rubric for our evaluation, but ultimately it is
up to your instructors as to whether your project is complete or incomplete.

We will evaluate your project according to the following criteria:

- **Code Quality:** Is the code well formatted? Are variable and function names
  semantic and sensible? Is the code easy to read and understand?
- **Technical Requirements:** How does the project stack up to the requirements
  for this project? Is the developer making use of the material we've covered in
  a way that makes sense?
- **Creativity & Interface:** Is the application easy to navigate? Does it work
  well in every major browser? Is it responsive? Does it incorporate modern UI
  Themes?
- **Functionality:** Does the application work without errors or bugs? Does it
  present a complete app, where every feature is fully implemented in a way that
  makes sense?
- **Presentation:** Is there adequate documentation? Is the repository well
  organized and free of clutter?

## Scoring

Each of the above categories will be scored according to the following:

| Score | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 0     | Incomplete  |
| 1     | Progressing |
| 2     | Performing  |
| 3     | Excelling   |

For a project to be considered complete, you must achieve at least "Progressing"
in each category. However, at a minimum, you should aim to achieve "Performing"
in every category.

## Hard Requirements

The following requirements **_must_** be met in order for the project to be
considered complete:

- Mobile first!
- The project is deployed to GitHub Pages or a custom domain
- The application renders in the browser and runs without errors
- The repo has a README that adequately documents the project

## Incomplete Projects

Incomplete projects will be giving a 1 week extension. **Note that you are
allowed one extension on only one of the four projects.**
